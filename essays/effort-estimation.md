TL;DR: It was gut feeling

## An Analysis on My Perceived and Actual Effort

For this software engineering final project, we were tasked with estimating and recording the time spent on issues posted by us in our project board. This essay serves as an analysis of my personal practices relating to this topic during the project.

## Estimations

To be honest, I made my effort estimates based off gut feeling. Albeit a gut feeling based off of previous coding or coding-adjacent assignments/projects I've done in the past. For example, I based the amount of time it would take me to implement a edit field form based on the amount of time it took me to complete a similar edit field assignment we've done in ICS 314.

That being said, it was still a gut feeling, and a lot of the times I underestimated the time it would take me. There were multiple instances where I was either 10 or an entire 30 minutes over my estimate.

## Actually Tracking

I believe tracking my estimates proved useful in organizing my thoughts. It allowed me to break down what I would think would be a daunting 24 hour long task, into easy-to-digest portions of that task.

In terms of actually tracking the time it took, I started off with a timer during M1 and partially M2. In all honesty, there were plenty of times where I forgot to start the timer, so I opted to just go based off of the start time, and the time I pushed the branch/code to origin. I believe it was somewhat accurate +/- 5 minutes.

## Future Considerations

Next time around I would definitely account for my underestimations during this project.

As for AI use, I didn't and don't think I'd use AI to track my effort or estimate how long a task would take. The former because tracking time is a menial task, and the latter because the AI doesn't know the extent of my abilities (very little).
