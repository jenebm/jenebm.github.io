*This is this, and that is that*

## Canto 1

I’m going to be completely honest, if you had told me two years ago that I would become a computer science student, I probably would have looked at you like a slack-jawed, front-facing fish. All my life, I actually wanted to become a Physical Therapist. Sure, I played video games like everyone else, but I never felt the urge to peek behind the screen. I never had a desire to create; I was always content with consuming. Funnily enough, what started nudging me toward creating wasn’t computer science itself, it was art!

## Intervallo 1.5

I decided to pick up art as a hobby, almost on a whim, as a New Year’s resolution. I’ve only been drawing for a little under two years, but in that short time, my desire to create has grown immensely. Ideas seemed to pour out of me, characters, environments, stories, animals, relationships. The only problem was figuring out how to bring them to life. I tried animation, but it was too confusing. Comics? I couldn’t figure out how to panel properly. Then I experimented with a very rudimentary visual novel, using HTML to display text alongside illustrations I had drawn.
That’s when it clicked for me. I spent weeks on that small project, I realized this was the form of storytelling I enjoyed most. It combined creativity with structure, exactly the kind of problem solving I didn’t realize I was craving. That’s when I told my parents I wanted to switch my major to computer science. How did they take it? Well… 

## Intervallo 1.5-2

Why didn’t I just switch to an art major, you ask? Great question. I asked myself the same thing, I even asked friends, some hobbyists, and one in the industry. The answer I kept hearing was the same: to get into an art field, all you really need is a solid portfolio (and connections). So I thought, if a portfolio is what matters the most, why not pursue a major that gives me technical skills in an art-adjacent field? Computer science would allow me to combine creativity with logic, giving me the tools to bring my ideas to life in ways a traditional art program might not. By combining my interest in art with programming, I could explore digital storytelling, interactive media, and other creative projects.

## Canto 2

After a couple classes of learning foundational skills of other languages, I’m finally in the class where I hope to learn what I’ve wanted. My current goal is to be able to create software, or even a website, in which I can express my storytelling in a more cohesive manner, complete with menus, dialogue boxes, history, saves, you know, normal video game stuff.

Beyond just building projects, I also hope to grow as a programmer by not only learning new languages, but also by developing the ability to quickly understand and apply new concepts. I want to strengthen my problem solving skills, create a set work flow, and gain the flexibility to overcome any challenges that are presented to me.

## Pass On

My hope for the future, beyond passing my classes, is to be able to continue creating projects that I enjoy. I’d like to get my boots on the ground in an entry-level programming position as well! From there, my dream is to get into a game studio, whether it be on the technical or artistic side.

*This is that, and that is this*
