## Introduction

Before taking ICS 314, I largely thought of software engineering as a class to be a class about purely technical skill development. Sure, I picked up skills such as React, HTML, Next.js, and all sorts of other tools, but going through the course I realize it was much more than those 'hard skills'. I learned what some would consider 'soft skills'—software engineering concepts that apply to not only the code itself, but the steps leading up to and after the creation of the code. Concepts such as coding standards and agile project management. Concepts I will be carrying on with me throughout my software engineering career.

## Coding Standards

One of the most consistently reinforced concepts throughout ICS 314 was the concept of coding standards. Coding standards were defined to us as a set of agreed-upon rules and conventions that define how code ought to be written and formatted. These standards include things such as naming, file organization, spacing, and code structure. While it may seem tedious at first, coding standards allow developers to read each other's code without conflict.

In this course, we used ESLint to automatically enforce a shared coding standard across our projects and assignments. ESLint flagged issues ranging from inconsistent formatting to potentially unsafe code. At times, like mentioned before, this felt tedious, especially when fixing errors that did not affect whether or not the code worked. However, over time, I came to understand that the purpose of coding standards is not just correctness, but clarity (I also just got used to it).

Obviously coding standards are especially important in team environments outside of ICS 314, where multiple developers contribute to the same project. Inconsistent coding styles can quickly lead to confusion, wasted time, and inefficiency. By enforcing these standards, it keeps everyone on the same page, allowing developers to allocate more of their energy to actually solving problems, rather than interpreting them.

## Agile Project Management

Another major software engineering concept emphasized in ICS 314 was agile project management. Agile project management is an approach to organizing work that puts flexibility, realistic progress, and frequent feedback first. Rather than assuming all requirements are known at the beginning of a project, this concept acknowledges that goals and constraints often change over time. Work is broken into small, bite-sized tasks that can be completed and adjusted as the project changes. This allows teams to make steady progress while being able to adapt to changes in the project.

In this course, we practiced a specific approach to this concept known as Issue Driven Project Management (I will be referring to it as IDPM). IDPM organizes all project work into clearly defined "issues," where each issue represents a task, feature, or bug. These issues are designed to be small enough to complete within a realistic amount of time depending on the constraints and deadline given. The issues are assigned to a team member, who becomes an assignee. Using tools such as GitHub Issues and project boards, teams and assignees can track progress, tasks, and completion status in an organized way. This concept made group projects more efficient and reduced confusion, since all my team members could see what needed to be done and who was working on it.

I can very much see the application IDPM has beyond web development. Any project that involves collaboration and an evolving set of requirements could benefit from this practice. By focusing on small, clearly defined tasks, agile project management helps prevent large problems from going unnoticed and makes daunting, complex projects feel more manageable.

## Going Forward

Overall, ICS 314 has developed much more than my hard/technical skills, but my soft skills as well. It has taught me coding practices that will remain relevant to me decades from now. It has taught me, but not exclusively, how to effectively collaborate with others, and how to manage and tackle complex and dynamic software engineering projects. I look forward to taking these concepts in stride as I move forward in my academic, and software engineering career.
