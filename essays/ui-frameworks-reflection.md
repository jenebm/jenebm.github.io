## Initial Thoughts

Before I even talk about UI frameworks like Bootstrap 5, I have to talk about learning HTML and CSS. Going through the required code bootcamp for both HTML and CSS I thought it was easy going at first. But as the mini-course went on I started to realize how tedious and boring actually typing out raw HTML and CSS was. which was why I was extremely grateful for the introduction of Bootstrap 5.

# The Good

The biggest change in my workflow when using Bootstrap 5 was how much less tedium there was. Using Boostrap, I could make a simple navigation bar with a selection of icons, and drop down menus. I know if I had tried doing this with raw HTML and CSS, it would have taken me *much* longer.

In fact, within a week of picking up Bootstrap I could make a recreation of a professionally built website (albeit a non-functional replica). The assignment required us to recreate two sections of a website of our choice. I had chose to recreate the xp-pen website. Below is my recreation of the website.

Pretty good right? Well, at least I think so... It even has a functional drop down menu, and image carousel!

The best part of this for me was I could create this replica within a single night, without much headache. The icons, buttons, and drop down menus were incredibly easy to implement because of Bootstraps pre-built features.

## The Bad

With my *currently* short experience with Bootstrap, I do have just a few grievances. Of course, using a UI Framework to create a website might and will cause your website to look very similar to other websites that use the same UI Framework. I feel like this restriction comes as a natural consequence of using a UI Framework. You are forced (well at least, *highly* encouraged) to stick within the style of the UI Framework.

In my case, wanting different or more creative liberty with Bootstrap 5 required me to overwrite Bootstrap's styles, which often became quite troublesome for me due to me constantly breaking my own features associated with the change I wanted to make.

## Conclusion

That being said, learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap5 has been a valuable experience. And while UI Frameworks like Bootstrap5 restrict you to stick within it's styles, I think the trade-off is more than worth it to save yourself the headache.
