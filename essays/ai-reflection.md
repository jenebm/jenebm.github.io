## Introduction

Over the course of the last half-decade, Artifical Intelligence has heavily influeced how students approached learning, this influence can be especially seen in software engineering. In ICS 314, I utilized LLM/AI tools like ChatGPT, and Claude as learning aids, and code generators for solutions to timed practice. This reflection will be an analysis of the ways AI affected me and my software engineering skills.

## Personal Experience with AI

# Experience WODs e.g. E18

For the experience WODs I mainly used ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Asking the AI to extrapolate on points that weren't exactly clear to me during the experiences.

As for the WODs themselves, I asked ChatGPT to produce tests for the code. If my code was non-functional and I couldn't deduce why, I'd copy and paste my code into ChatGPT to get a solution back.

# In-class Practice WODs

For the in-class practice WODs, I refrained from using ChatGPT as much. I tried relying on table discussion with my classmates to work through a solution.

However, there were times where all of us would not be able to come up with a solution. It was then, that either I or another table member would ask ChatGPT or some other LLM to produce a solution/hint.

# In-class WODs

For the timed WODs, I made use of AI heavily. As the timed WOD had, of course, time constraints, and was either pass-or-fail depending on if the code functions or not.

For the majority of the in-class WODs, I copy and pasted the instructions into ChatGPT to produce an initial solution. I got it to a working state, and if I had the time I'd analyze the code to see how it worked.

# Essays

When writing essays, I made use of ChatGPT to produce an outline to organize my content.

I also asked it to generate examples paragraphs of a section if I was having trouble coming up with ideas. I would read the section in ChatGPT and then close it to ensure I wouldn't be copying from the LLM directly.

# Final project

I used ChatGPT and Claude to troubleshoot my other members code during the final project.

For example, there were multiple instances where a branch would fail to deploy to vercel. I would go to vercel's logs and copy and paste the error message into ChatGPT/Claude. The LLM would analyze the error message and help me troubleshoot the issue.

# Learning a concept / tutorial

As described the experience WOD section of this essay, I used ChatGPT to further explain a concept taught in the experience that I either didn't understand initially, or wanted to understand more.

# Answering a question in class or in Discord

When the instructor would be speaking he'd sometimes ask a question to the class, if I didn't know the answer to the question I'd search the answer to the question on google. While not intending to use AI, much of the results had the AI explanation show up as the first result.

# Asking or answering a smart-question

I wouldn't use AI to try and ask a question

# Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I don't think I used AI to generate many coding examples, if any at all. All of the examples provided with the assignments were more than sufficient.

# Explaining code

If I didn't understand code my team members created, I'd often copy and paste it into an LLM to explain either line by line, or block by block depending on the code.

# Writing code

A lot of the times I used AI to generate a 'starting' code for me to work on. I'd lay out what solution I had in mind after reading the instructions, and give the LLM the plan I had.

# Documenting code

I didn't really ask the AI to document the code as most of the time the AI would already comment on code generated by itself.

# Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
Other uses in ICS 314 not listed~

I did exactly the two examples listed in this section. Especially when ESLint threw me the "do not nest ternary expressions" lint check.

## Impact on Learning and Understanding

Honestly I'm a little bit iffy on whether or not AI has positvely or negatively impacted my learning experience. While it is certain that AI has considerably sped up the rate at which I complete assignments, and reduced the mental load on myself to do said assignments, I am concerned for how much I am actually learning.

I try to refrain from AI doing entire or majority of assignments for me, and try to use it as an aid rather than a replacement. But its starting to feel like a slippery slope for me.

I still do not understand if AI is enhancing or negatively impacting my learning experience, but I will continue to experiment with different approaches to AI use until I do.

## Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, AI can be used for real-world software engineering projects similar to the ones we've done in class. Outside of software engineering, AI can be used in many different ways. One of which I'm familiar with is to generate ideas for any personal projects of mine, unrelated to programming.

## Challenges and Opportunities

Often times AI will not understand the initial prompt given to it, and generate, in the context of ICS 314 assignments, code that doesn't work or doesn't function the way you intended. Most of the time, multiple passes will be needed to get to an 'ideal' solution.

Another challenge, as mentioned previously, is the overreliance on AI. AI use, especially for students, is a slippery slope that many can fall down on. It's easy for students, like myself, to be hamstrung by AI and not know how to do an assignment without it.

## Comparative Analysis

AI has enhanced my engagement, and knowlege retention in courses in general, it allows me to quickly get myself up to speed during a lecture and not fall into a spiral of not understanding and giving up during it. However, I think that AI has stunted my practical skill development, as I believe that I am becoming too reliant on AI.

## Future Considerations

As mentioned previously, I will continue to account for my overreliance on AI by experimenting with different methods of AI usage during my academic career. I will try and be more methodical and thoughtful with my AI use as to not be dependent on AI.

## Conclusion

Overall, I believe my use with AI has been a mixed experience with this course. Not from the fault of the course itself, but from my own usage. It has boosted my engagement and knowledge retention with the course material, but has severely stunted my growth in practical skill development. Going forward I will continue to optimize my AI usage in a way that doesn't hamper my growth, but instead enhance my overall learning experience.
