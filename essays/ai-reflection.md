## Introduction

Over the course of the last half-decade, Artifical Intelligence has heavily influeced how students approached learning, this influence can be especially seen in software engineering. In ICS 314, I utilized LLM/AI tools like ChatGPT, and Claude as learning aids, and code generators for solutions to timed practice. This reflection will be an analysis of the ways AI affected me and my software engineering skills.

## Personal Experience with AI

Experience WODs e.g. E18

For the experience WODs I mainly used ChatGPT as a learning assistant. Asking the AI to extrapolate on points that weren't exactly clear to me during the experiences.

As for the WODs themselves, I asked ChatGPT to produce tests for the code. If my code was non-functional and I couldn't deduce why, I'd copy and paste my code into ChatGPT to get a solution back.

In-class Practice WODs

For the in-class practice WODs, I refrained from using ChatGPT as much. I tried relying on table discussion with my classmates to work through a solution.

However, there were times where all of us would not be able to come up with a solution. It was then, that either I or another table member would ask ChatGPT or some other LLM to produce a solution/hint.

In-class WODs

For the timed WODs, I made use of AI heavily. As the timed WOD had, of course, time constraints, and was either pass-or-fail depending on if the code functions or not.

For the majority of the in-class WODs, I copy and pasted the instructions into ChatGPT to produce an initial solution. I got it to a working state, and if I had the time I'd analyze the code to see how it worked.

Essays

When writing essays, I made use of ChatGPT to produce an outline to organize my content.

I also asked it to generate examples paragraphs of a section if I was having trouble coming up with ideas. I would read the section in ChatGPT and then close it to ensure I wouldn't be copying from the LLM directly.

Final project

I used ChatGPT and Claude to troubleshoot my other members code during the final project.

For example, there were multiple instances where a branch would fail to deploy to vercel. I would go to vercel's logs and copy and paste the error message into ChatGPT/Claude. The LLM would analyze the error message and help me troubleshoot the issue.

Learning a concept / tutorial

As described the experience WOD section of this essay, I used ChatGPT to further explain a concept taught in the experience that I either didn't understand initially, or wanted to understand more.
