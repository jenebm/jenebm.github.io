## Introduction

I believe when most beginner-level programmers (at least I) hear the phrase "coding standards," they often think of trivial arguments like tabs vs. space, curly braces on new lines, or whether comments should align with other comments. These things *do* matter but after a week with ESLint I believe it goes much deeper.

Coding standards, as the way it was introduced in this class, is a way to prevent errors, and maintain clarity for not just yourself but for others.

## ESLint

After my first week of using ESLint in VSCode, I went through the typical experience of picking up something new. Getting frustrated at trivial errors were a big pain point for me, here's a few of my thoughts going through ESLint for the first time.

*"I DID indent it why is it telling me I didn't?"*  

*"I deleted it and indented again, why is it throwing an error STILL??"*  

*"Are you serious. It uses double spaces??"*  

*"Why do you care about what I name my variable?"*  

*"Stop throwing an error at me, I AM going to use this function, just WAIT"*

As you can see I was very frustrated at the constant errors thrown at me during the coding process. It certainly did feel that the errors were like a chore to get rid of. But after cleaning up all the errors, I was presented with an extremely clean and streamlined piece of code. My code was extremely readable.

## As a Whole

I believe coding standards enforced by programs like ESLint matter even more in teams. Imagine reading a codebase where every developer uses a different naming conventions, or indention style. I imagine it'd be a headache, having to constantly readjust when looking at their piece of code.

By ensuring everyone follows the same coding standards, we can lessen the strain on the individual developer. Rather than have them straining, trying to readjust to different pieces of code.

## Conclusion

Setting my initial frustrations with ESLint aside, I do genuinely see the importance of the program itself and the coding standards it enforces. It promotes clarity, prevents errors, and ensures other developers in the same team can read your code without issue. Moving forward, whether it be ESLint or another program, I will be adding some form of coding standards to my projects.
