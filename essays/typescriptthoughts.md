## First Impressions

I’ll be honest, I’m still a beginner when it comes to programming, so what I can offer is more like a cent than two. That being said, I find TypeScript to be a very pleasant extension of JavaScript. When I first learned that JavaScript was dynamically typed, my concern was whether I’d be able to read existing code easily without clear data types. Don’t get me wrong, I appreciated JavaScript’s simpler syntax compared to the verbosity of Java (I never quite got used to all the boilerplate in Java…). But I often wondered if “simpler” really meant “easier to understand.” That’s why TypeScript stood out to me, its static typing and defined data types gave me a sense of structure and peace of mind.

## TypeScript for Software Engineers

From my perspective, as a beginner, TypeScript feels sufficient for most projects. Since so many web applications run on JavaScript, having a superset of it that adds safety features seems like a good thing. The ability to catch errors at compile time rather than runtime saves a huge amount of headache, especially for someone still building confidence (read: me).

I’d also argue that TypeScript improves readability. Even though it requires more text than JavaScript, being able to identify data types at a glance makes code clearer and easier to understand.

## WODs.

Athletic software engineering, that’s what Mānoa’s computer science program calls its in-class exercises. I find the name charming, but fitting. As much as WODs can be stressful, they’re also very helpful in sharpening my skills.
Coming from an art background, I’ve experienced the value of timed practice firsthand. I can spend hours refining a still life, but when I work under time limits, I’m forced to capture the essential forms quickly rather than obsessing over details. That constraint pushes growth, pressure creates diamonds afterall. I think the same applies to WODs, coding under time pressure forces me to prepare thoroughly, and refine my approach. It’s stressful, but it’s also a great way to improve.
